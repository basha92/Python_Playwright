What is Playwright
Itâ€™s a tool to test websites from start to end (like how a user uses it)
--
What browsers does it work with?
Works with all big browsers:
Chromium (like Chrome, Edge)
WebKit (like Safari)
Firefox
--
What OS does it work with?
Windows
Linux
Mac
Can run tests in CI/CD ( Jenkins etc.)
headless (no browser window) OR headed (you see browser open)
can also pretend to be a mobile phone (mobile emulation)

Before we beginâ€¦  Letâ€™s check our system is ready
At least 4 GB RAM (8 GB better)
Disk space: around 1.5 GB 
Stable internet

Uses of playwright
ðŸ”¹ 1. Web Application Testing
Automates modern web apps across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers.
Handles single-page apps (SPAs) better than Selenium.
Can test multiple tabs, pop-ups, and iframes reliably.
Use case: Automating login â†’ navigating dashboard â†’ submitting forms â†’ verifying results.
ðŸ”¹ 2. Cross-Browser and Cross-Platform Testing
Same test can run on Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox.
Supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Can also run tests in headless mode for CI/CD pipelines
Use case: Ensuring a hospitalâ€™s web portal works in Chrome and Safari (important in medical devices domain).
ðŸ”¹ 3. API Testing
Built-in support for sending HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).
Can combine API + UI testing in one framework.
Use case: Verify that when a patient record is created via API, it also appears correctly in the UI.
ðŸ”¹ 4. Mobile Web Testing
Can emulate mobile devices (Pixel, iPhone, iPad, etc.).
Useful for responsive design testing.
Use case: Testing that a medical appâ€™s patient portal works on mobile browsers.
ðŸ”¹ 5. Parallel and Fast Execution
Runs tests in parallel with built-in test runner.
Faster than Selenium because it interacts directly with browser engines.
Use case: Running hundreds of automated regression tests overnight.
ðŸ”¹ 6. Network-Level Testing
Can intercept, mock, or modify network requests.
Helps test apps even when backend APIs are not ready.
Use case: Mocking a server response when the medical device backend is still in development.
ðŸ”¹ 7. Visual and Screenshot Testing
Captures screenshots and generates videos of test runs.
Can do visual comparisons between runs.
Use case: Documenting test evidence for FDA audits (screenshots attached to test results).
ðŸ”¹ 8. Continuous Integration (CI/CD)
Works well with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps.
Runs automatically on every code change.
Use case: Every software update in a medical device triggers automated regression tests.
ðŸ”¹ 9. Multi-Language Support
Works with Python, Java, C#, TypeScript/JavaScript.
You can choose the language based on your comfort and project needs.
âœ… In summary: Playwright is used to automate UI, API, cross-browser, mobile web, and network-level testing. 
Itâ€™s fast, reliable, and ideal for regulated industries where traceability and evidence are crucial.
